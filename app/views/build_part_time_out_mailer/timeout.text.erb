Kochiku timeout for build part <%= link_to(project_build_part_path(build_part.build_instance.project, build_part.build_instance, build_part), @build_part.id) %>

Go take a look! Hop onto <%= @builder %> and take it out of rotation. Either `sudo monit stop kochiku-worker` on EC2 or `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.squareup.kochiku-worker-*` on a macbuild.
